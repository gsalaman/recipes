For the knots:
* 3 3/4 cups bread flour
* 1/2 TBSPP sugar
* 2 1/4 tsp yeast
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 2 TBSP oil

For garlic coating:
* 1 stick butter
* 6 spoonfuls garlic
* 1/2 cup fresh parsley
* 1.5 tsp garlic salt

3 3/4 cup bread flour
1.5 tsp sugar
2.25 tsp yeast
2 tsp salt

Turn mixer on low spped, add 1 1/2 cup warm water and 2 TBSP oil.
Want a solid ball. 
If too sticky, add flour, 1 tbsp at a time
If too dry, add water, 1 tbsp at a time.

Kneed.

Grease bowl with oil, cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit 90 min.

Turn dough on lightly floured surface.  Divide into 2 equal pieces.  Place each piece on a piece of plastic wrap, and let sit for 10 min.

Dust with light springling of flour and slice each into quarters.

Press each quarter into a rectangle, and slice in half again. You should now have 16 dough pieces.

Dust each piece with a little more flour, and quickly shape into balls.

Roll these out into a long rope and tie in a knot.  

Place on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Let rise another 30 min.

Preheat overn to 425. Original said 450, but I like the way those turn out. 

Make garlic coating:
* Mince 1/2 cup italian parsley.
* Melt stick butter over medium heat.  
* Add garlic and smmer for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  DONT OVERCOOK!!!
* Add parsley and garlic salt.  Taste.  May need more salt.  Remove from heat

Don't need to brush knots beforehand.

Bake knots for 20 min, until golden brown.  Check at 15.  

Let rest for 5 min, then brush with sauce.

Sprinkle with parm.
