# Smoked Salmon

I like to use a 2.5-3 lb filet for this.

Dry brine:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup kosher salt
1 packet fresh dill, chopped
pepper

Sauce:
1 cup mayo
1 TBSP Sriracha
1 TBSP Worstershire
1/2 lime's juice, fresh squeezed
salt to taste (1/2 tsp)

Gonna want to let the salmon brine for ~4 hrs prior to starting the smoker.

Remove any pin bones from the salmon...note they will get softer and reabosrb, so not critical.

mix together the salt and sugar.
Put a small bed down in a casserole pan.
Put salmon on top.
grind out some pepper on top...just like you were seasoning a steak.
Add the Dill in a layer.
Then cover with rest of the brine
Cover with plastic wrap, and put in the fridge.

Want the sauce sitting and melding for a while as well, so this is a good time to mix together all those ingredients.

Smoking:
Take salmon out of fridge...should have loads of liquid, and have firmed up.
Start fire going in chimney.
Rince off the salmon.
Get the smoker stabalized...I used water in the pan.
Make a sling out of foil to transfer and cook salmon...fold piece in half.
Add salmon and smoking wood to the smoker.
I liked Pecan wood...3 chunks.
First time:  smoked at 235 for a little more than an hour until salmon was 140.  If you want it more rare, may go to 135.  Wouldn't go much higher than 145.
