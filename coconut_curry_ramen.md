# Coconut Curry Ramen
I start by doing a pork tenderloin sous-vide...season with kosher salt and pepper.  Sous-vide @140 for 1 hour.   Sear with butter in the pan you 
will be using to make the ramen...for 3, I do a 12" skillet, but for a large batch (5 bricks) I'll use either a dutch oven or stockpan.

Whilst the pork is sous-viding, do the hard-boiled eggs.  I like putting 6 or 7 in a smaller saucepan, then covering with water up to 1" above.
Bring uncovered to a boil, then cover and take off heat.  Let set for 12 min.  Rince in cold water, and use a mason jar to help peel.

Whilst the pork is searing, chop up a bunch of scallions for garnish, and make the base sauce.  For that big batch, I do:
* 1 can coconut milk
* 1 jar curry paste (I like [this](https://www.safeway.com/shop/product-details.127051168.html?cmpid=ps_swy_den_ecom_goo_20200924_71700000073036118_58700006935075127_92700062355099076&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ5ff9EqWz-Fo5d3CvUhDxHUxGPT9Tf97Eek1hdTv2IVXLMGb4ohgEIaApOsEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds))
* 2 TBSP Fish sauce
I mix it all in a 2Cup measuring cup.

If you like mushrooms, slice up about 6-8 Shittake caps lengthwise, and put to the side.  No stems...they're too tough.

Make broth on the side.  I use the same broth cubes as in the hot-n-sour receipe...one chicken, one beef, and about 6 cups of water.

Okay, now your pork is seared.  Take it out of the pan and let it rest.

Add a little oil to the pan, and sautee those mushrooms...should take about 4 minutes at medium high heat.

Once they're soft, add 2 heaping spoonfulls of garlic and one regular spoonful of ground ginger.  Cook until fragrant (30s)

Now add the broth and the curry sauce.  Lower heat to medium.  Stir.  Add ramen bricks (5-6 for that big batch), and bring to a simmer.

After ramen is just soft, add 1 TBSP soy.  Taste sauce to see if it needs more.

Plating:  I like cutting the hard-boiled eggs in half, putting them in the bottom of a bowl with a couple slices of pork, add noodles and broth, and top with scallions and baby spinach.
