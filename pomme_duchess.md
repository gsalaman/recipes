From Julia

Ingredients:
* 6 russet potatoes, about 4.5” x 2” each
* Salt
* 6 egg yolks
* 6 TBSP soft butter (+ more)
* 4-6 TBSP Creme Fraiche or heavy creme or crema
* 1/8 tsp white pepper
* Pinch nutmeg
* Parm or Swiss, finely grated.

Scrub potatoes in warm water.  
Peel and quarter potatoes.  

Put in dutch oven, with 1 TBSP salt.  Set over high heat.  Boil, partially covered, for 25 min…maybe more.  Want them cooked through & mealy.

Put potatoes in stand mixer until you have lump free puree.  If there’s too much liquid in here, you can put back in pan and warm…but not usually necessary.

Preheat oven to 400. 

Beat in egg yolks (6) and 6 TBSP soft butter.
Then add 4 TBSP cream…still want it fairly firm.  Add 1 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp white pepper, and pinch of nutmeg.

Form potatoes in baking pan.  Top with finely grated Swiss or parm, and dribble on butter.

Cook in top-third of oven for 25-30 minutes.  Want brown crispies on top.
