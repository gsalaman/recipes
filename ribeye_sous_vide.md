# Ribeye steak, sous-vide style

Bag up the steaks individually...you are going to want a little water around them.  Season before bagging with:
* Fresh Thyme
* Fresh Rosemary
* Kosher Salt
* Pepper
* Garlic Salt

Then, sous-vide them at 130 for 2.5 hrs.  

Then, pan-sear in a cast iron skillet in a bunch of butter...you want just past the foaming stage.
