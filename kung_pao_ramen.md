For 4:
* 1 lb protien
* cooking oil
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1 green bell pepper
* 3/4 cup roasted peanuts (unsalted)
* 3 BIG spoonfulls garlic
* 1 tbsp ginger
* 1 tsp red pepper

* 1 TBSP sesame oil

Optional:  
* Hard boiled eggs
* Scallions 

So I've done this with Chicken, Tofu, and shrimp.  Alli likes the shrimp best. 

1st:  Make the broth. I like doing 8 cups water with 2 1/2 TBSP "better than bouillion

If doing a non-veg version, I'd do the protein first...either cook chicken, or warm shrimp, or brown tofu.  You'll use those juices further on.  Can use the same pan for all.
Remove protien, then soften pepper and peanuts (2-3 min), then remove and proceed.

non-veg protein (light warm for shrimp, higher for cooking chicken).  Then remove protien.

Now, you are on to the broth stuff.  In broth pan, heat 2 TBSP oil.  Add Garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes.  Heat until fragrant (30s)

Add broth.  Add ramen bricks.  Stir until tender (just a couple minutes).

Stir in Hosin, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.  If you are doing tofu, add here.

If veg, do the bell peppers and peanuts first in a 12" skillet, then 
Next, heat about 2-4 TBSP oil on medium-high heat (7).  Dice the bell peppers.

Once oil is warm, put in peppers and peanuts.  Heat for about 2-3 minutes until soft.  Remove to a bowl.

Next, heat/cook protien in that residual oil.  If doing chicken, you may want t
