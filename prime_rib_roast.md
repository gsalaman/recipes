# Prime Rib Roast, traditional

From https://40aprons.com/easy-prime-rib-recipe-au-jus-paleo-whole30/ 

Night before, make horseradish.  Note this is different than my standard...gonna try it and see:

Mix:
* 8 oz full fat sour creme
* 1/2 cup full fat mayo  (trying real rather than my std olive oil type)
* 1 TBSP finely chopped green onion.  (rather than my std chives)
* 1 TBSP horseradish
* 1 TBSP chopped dill
* 2 TSP dijon
* 2 tsp white wine vinegar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt

For prime rib, preheat oven to 450.  Take out butter that morning.
Start by seasoning all sides with salt and pepper, as you would the tenderloin roast.

Mix 1/4 cup butter, 2 spoonfulls garlic, and 1 TBSP fresh minced rosemary.  Use fork until well incorporated, then rub it on all sides of the prime rib.

Put roast in oven for 15 min, then lower temp to 325.
Want to go to 115-118 from this site...most others say 120.

Baste every 30 min using a brush.

Let rest 20 min when done.

Au Jus:
Heat medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  When warm, add 4 TBSP of those drippings...use butter if you don't have enough.

When those are melted, use 2 TBSP flour to make a roux.

Pour 1/4 cup red win into this and whisk vigorously to incorporate.  Mixture will likely become purple and gooey.  

Simmer for 2 minutes (or until sharp alcohol smell is gone.)

Slowly pour 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce into mix.  whisk until fully incorporated.

Add 1 TBSP Worshershire and another 1.5 Cups broth.  Boil 5 min until slightly thickened and reducd.  Season with salt and fresh pepper.
