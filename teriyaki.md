# Teriyaki

* 2 lbs meat
* 2 TBSP veggie oil
* 1/2 cup soy
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 TBSP Mirin
* 2 tsp corn starch
* 2 tsp ginger
* 1 garlic clove (or 1 spoonfull minced)
* 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
* 2 scallions, minced
* sesame seeds
* rice


Here’s the hard part:  trim the meat thin.  I first trimmed the big pieces of flank, then cut them into about 2” sections *with* the grain.  
I could then do thin slices *against* the grain, and some of those I would either cut in half, or trim around the center gristle piece.  
Removing as much fat as possible makes this *really* work.  Alternatively, I use left over tenderloin.  YUMMMMMMY!!!!

Heat 1 TBSP vege oil in 12” skillet…I did it on 8.  While this is warming, make the sauce and mince the scallions.

Mix 1/2 cup soy, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tbsp Mirin, 2 tsp corn starch, 2 tsp ginger, and one spoonful of garlic.  Sprinkle a little bit of red pepper flakes.

Brown half the meat on both sides.  Careful *NOT* to over cook.  Transfer to a clean bowl, then do the other half, and also remove to bowl.

Reduce heat a little (7ish), and add sauce to skillet.  mix it all up until it’s kinda thick…I had mine bubble up, so I kept stiring and removing from heat.   Add in the steak and their juices, and simmer until heated through (just a little bit).  

I did the microwave rice here.

Transfer to serving bowl, sprinkle top with sesame seeds and scallions.
