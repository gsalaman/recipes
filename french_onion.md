T-115 (hour and 45)
Start dutch oven warming first, empty.  Medium low heat…I did 3.

Slice all the onions!  Save 1/2 raw.  When getting near the end, add cooking oil to pot (assuming it’s hot by now)

T-90
Melt 1 1/2 TBSP butter into oil.  
Stir sliced onion into oil/butter mix, make sure they are evenly coated.  
Cover and cook for around 20 min, checking to make sure they aren’t burning.  Onions should be clear and very tender once finished.  

While this is cooking, do a couple preps:
1)  1/4 tsp sugar+1/2 salt for carmelizing onion.  I think I actually did 1/2 and 1/2.
2)  1/4 tsp sage, 1 bay leaf for stock.
3) Make stock, if necessary
4)  Grate the cheese
5)  Slice up french bread, and drizzle both sides wik oil (on a baking sheet.  Prefer *no* parchment paper here.
6)  Grate up that half onion.

T-70
Turn up heat to medium high, add 1/4 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp salt.  Stir and cook until onions are carmalized.  This took about 10-15 min…and I did 7 for a bit, then 8.

Pre-heat oven to 325 here!

T-50
Reduce heat to medum low, stir in 1.5 TBSP flour.  Cook for 2-3 minutes until flour forms a thick paste (add more butter if needed-I did another tbsp)
Stir in 1/2 cup beef stock, and stir heavilly for a couple seconds.

T-45
Add rest of the stock, wine, sage, and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 min.

(Pre-heat oven to 325.)  Drizzle both sides of french bread slices with oil, then place on baking sheet.  Cook bread in oven for 15 min each side.   If you prepped the bread and oven earlier, you are ready to go here…and the 15 min + 15 bread equals the simmer for the soup.
Finish up any of the 4/5/6 above here.

T-10
Remove bay leaf, grate 1/4 raw onion into the soup.  Add a little bit of the swiss to the soup.  Cover soup with brea, sprinkle rest of cheese on top.  Drizzle melted butter over cheses, and place pot into oven uncovered.  Bake until cheese melted, then turn on broiler to brown.  
Baking:  about 5 min at 325, then broiled another 5.
