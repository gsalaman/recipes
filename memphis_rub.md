You can either leave these "carnivore" style, or clean them up.  If you want to clean them:

* Trim skirt off the back.  Save and cook...it's yummy!
* Trim off membrane.  Butter knife, paper towel helps.
* trim off rib tips...squares the rib rack
* now, on the thin end, you may want to take a couple off.  They're smaller and will dry out.  Maybe one off the thick end if it's goofy.
