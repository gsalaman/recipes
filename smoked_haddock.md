# Smoked Haddock

These fillets are thinner than the salmon, so you need to be a little more careful about smoking them.

Soak in bath of bay leaves, milk, and peppercorns overnight...did 6 bay leaves and about a tablespoon of whole peppercorns in the bath whilst they were thawing overnight in fridge.

Pat dry.  Maybe rub with olive oil?

Rub:
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp garlic powder

Did pecan wood...paired really well!  Smoke until internal temp is 138 (just like salmon).  They're thinner fillets, so they require a little more care than the salmon.
