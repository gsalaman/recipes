# Pork Belly scrap breakfast sausage 

Try and get the grind above 50%.  70/30 is the conventional wisdom.  It'll be fine on the lower end, but "mushier" with the bacon fat.

Mix, for 1-1.5# sausage:
1/4 tsp fine salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/2 tsp sage
1/4 tsp fennel seed

## orig
  

Took some of the pork belly scraps that didn't make good cubes for burnt ends and ground 'em up.  Conventional wisdom is 70/30, but my scraps were a little fattier than that.  Didn't matter.

Tried plain (blah), just salt and peper (meh), and the burnt end rub (okay).

Did a variation that was too salty...want to try this next time:

For 1# sausage:
1/4 tsp fine salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/2 tsp sage
