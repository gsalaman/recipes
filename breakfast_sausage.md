  # Pork Belly scrap breakfast sausage 

Took some of the pork belly scraps that didn't make good cubes for burnt ends and ground 'em up.  Conventional wisdom is 70/30, but my scraps were a little fattier than that.  Didn't matter.

Tried plain (blah), just salt and peper (meh), and the burnt end rub (okay).

Did a variation that was too salty...want to try this next time:
