I tweaked the spices a little and left off the oats...texture much better, but spice mix still not quite there yet.  Too sweet...want to go more savory and spicy next time.

Ingredients:
* 1 cup veggie broth
* 1 cup TVP
* 2 TBSP Chia seeds
* 2 TBSP Soy
* 1 TBSP Maple syrup
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp fennel
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp black pepper



## Take 1, BLEAH!!!

from https://bohemianvegankitchen.com/vegan-breakfast-sausage-recipe/#h-this-vegan-lentil-sausage-recipe-is-easy-to-make-and-use-all-week-long

Ingredients:
* 3 cups veggie broth
* 1 cup dried brown lentils (or green?)
* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 cup chia
* 3 tbsp maple syrup
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp fennel seed
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp sage
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 1/2 tsp black papper
* 1/2 tsp salt

Make 3 cups broth....bring to boil.

While that's going, rince lentils. Once broth is boiling, move heat to medium high, and cook for 15-20 min (until lentils cooked through)

Preheat oven to 400.

Transfer cooked lentils to a mixing bowl, and add the rest of the ingredients.  Mix until combined well.

Make into patties and put on baking sheet with parchment paper.  bake for 15 min.

Texture totally wrong...too dry and mealy.  Spice okay.
