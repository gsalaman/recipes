# Vegan Breakfast Sausage

## Take 3:  half batch with spices tweaked
* 1/2 cup broth
* 1/2 cup TVP
* 1 TBSP chia
* 2 TBSP soy
* 2 TBSP flour
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp garlic
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 tsp white pepper
* 1/4 tsp sage
* 1/4 tsp thyme

Note:  no fennel or corriander.  Also ditched the onion, but uppded the pepper.

MUCH closer!  Used regular soy, maybe a little salty.  Good spice mix...maybe try adding back in a little fennel or coriander.

##  Take 2: texture better
From https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/easy-vegan-breakfast-sausage-patties-tvp-patties/
I tweaked the spices a little and left off the oats...texture much better, but spice mix still not quite there yet.  Too sweet...want to go more savory and spicy next time.

Ingredients:
* 1 cup veggie broth
* 1 cup TVP
* 2 TBSP Chia seeds
* 2 TBSP Soy
* 1 TBSP Maple syrup
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp fennel
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp sage

Make broth...1 cup water, 1 tsp veggie boulion mix

Let cool a little, then add TVP, chia, soy, and maple syrup.  Let sit 10 min.

Add flour, paprika, fennel, garlic, onion, and black pepper.  

Heat oil in skillet, fry 'em up over medium low heat...I actually did 5, and it worked pretty good.  5-ish minutes a side.

So I think next time, lose the Maple...replace with soy.
Want more pepper...got to 1/2 tsp black and 1/2 tsp white?
May need extra salt...but do one batch first to see.  (1/2 tsp fine?)
Also add 1/2 tsp thyme?  Maybe lose the fennel?

Erika recommeded doing a fine mince and frying up some sweet onion...
Jimmy dean copycat does 3/4 sage, 1/4 thyme, 1/4 garlic salt, 1/2 dried parsley, 1/4 tsp coriander (ground!), 1/8 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp red pepper.

## Take 1, BLEAH!!!

from https://bohemianvegankitchen.com/vegan-breakfast-sausage-recipe/#h-this-vegan-lentil-sausage-recipe-is-easy-to-make-and-use-all-week-long

Ingredients:
* 3 cups veggie broth
* 1 cup dried brown lentils (or green?)
* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 cup chia
* 3 tbsp maple syrup
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp fennel seed
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp sage
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 1/2 tsp black papper
* 1/2 tsp salt

Make 3 cups broth....bring to boil.

While that's going, rince lentils. Once broth is boiling, move heat to medium high, and cook for 15-20 min (until lentils cooked through)

Preheat oven to 400.

Transfer cooked lentils to a mixing bowl, and add the rest of the ingredients.  Mix until combined well.

Make into patties and put on baking sheet with parchment paper.  bake for 15 min.

Texture totally wrong...too dry and mealy.  Spice okay.
