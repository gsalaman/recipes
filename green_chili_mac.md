# Green Chili Mac-n-cheese

Tweaked from a recipe from Erika!

Shred 8 oz cheddar and 8 oz jack....I did sharp for the first, and got a little grain.  Want to try medium or mild...

Make 16 oz cooked pasta.

Make roux of 3 TBSP butter and flour.  Add salt and pepper...1 tsp each.

Incorporate 2 cups half-n-half

Add in 1 4oz cans of Hatch Green chili and shredded cheese.  

When all roux, cream, chilis, and cheese has all been incorporated, add the pasta and serve.

* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic
* 1/2 tsp onion
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
