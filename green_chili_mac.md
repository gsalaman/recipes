# Erika's Green Chili Mac-n-cheese

For each 8 oz cooked pasta:

Make roux of 3 TBSP butter and flour.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Incorporate 2 cups heavy cream.  Can use whole milk or other milk of your choice.

Add in 2 4oz cans of Hatch Green chili and 18 Oz shredded cheese.  Mix sharp cheddar with mexican mix.  Can do cheddar and mozzerella too.

When all roux, cream, chilis, and cheese has all been incorporated, add the pasta and serve.

others say use 2 cans per 16 oz.  Family test:  4 cans, 32 oz pasta.  
Erika's is salt and pepper to taste.  Others have cumin, garlic, onion, and oregano....
They do 3 cups per 16 oz (erika's would be 4).  I'm gonna tend higher.

Their spice mix, per 3 cups (3+3T roux):  
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic
* 1/2 tsp onion
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano

Hmmm...this may be too much...maybe first time just do the salt and pepper.

So, for shopping list:
32 oz macaroni (2 boxes?)
12 TBSP butter (stick and a half)
3/4 cup flour 
8 cups heavy cream
