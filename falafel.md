# Falafel

Ingredients:
* 2c chickpeas
* 1c parsely
* juice 1 lemon
* 6 scoops garlic
* 1 TBSP black papper
* 1 TBSP cumin
* 1 TBSP ground corriander
* 1 TBSP paprika
* 2 TSP cinnamon
* 1 TSP salt
* 1 TSP baking soda
* 2 TBSP sesame seeds
  
Start with dried chickpeas.  Rehydrate in water, at least 24 hrs.  Add 1/2 TSP baking soda per cup of dried beans.  Note...these will double in size, so if you want 2c beans (like the recepie says), do 1c dried.

Put everythign by baking soda and sesame seeds in food processor.  Munge it into a paste....then refriderate for at least 1 hr.

Before frying, add 1 tsp baking soda and 2 TBSP sesame seeds.  If mix is too goopy, you can add 1 egg and/or 1/4 cup flour.  On one iteration (with canned beans) I added about a cup of flour to get it to hold together....that totally took away from the taste.
