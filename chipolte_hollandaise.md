# Chipolte Hollandaise

Ingredients:
* 3 egg yolks
* 1.5 TBSP fresh lemon juice
* 1 TBSP hot water
* 10 TBSP unsalted butter
* 1 chipolte pepper in adobo sauce

Start by melting the butter over low heat in a small saucepan.

Whilst butter is melting, seperate 3 eggs.  Yolks go in blender.

Add 1 TBSP hot water and 1.5 TBSP fresh lemon juice (receipe calls for 1, but I like the little extra lemonyness)  
Blend for 1 minute.

Then, with blender running, pour butter in through hole on blender in a slow stream.  Then let it go for another minute.

Put in a quarter TSP salt and one medium chipolte pepper.  Don't really want more...it'll overpower it.  Blend for another 30 seconds.

They want you to keep it warm...but I ran into trouble with it getting too hot and breaking inedibly.  Just use it right away.
