* 4 russet potatos
* 2 lemons
* Canola Oil
* Pepper
* Kosher salt
* 1/4 cup Mayo
* 2 TBSP red wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup Olive Oil
* 2 TBSP dijon mustard
* Smoked paprika
* Parsley

Cut potatos into wedges.  Place in dutch oven, and cover with water.  Add about a tsp salt.
Cover and bring to boil, then remove lid, reduce heat so it's simmering rather than boil, and let 'em par-boil.  Recepie says 5-10 min; I was closer to 15-20.  And that's after the 20ish min for the water to boil.

When done, you want only slight resistence from fork.  Let cool a little whilst:

Cut lemons in half, and grill 'em up.

Brush potatos with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until nicely marked and done.  Recepie says 2-3 min on high; I ended up doing about 3 min for each of the "third" for the wedge.

For dressing, whisk together 1/4 cup mayo, 2 tbsp dijon, 2 TBSP red wine vinegar, juice from lemons.  
Then wisk in 1/4 cup olive oil.  Season with a little salt (1 tsp?), and generous amount of pepper (1-2 TBSP?)

Pull potatos from Grill to platter.  
Sprinkle with paprika  
Drizzle dressing (want to make sure they're still hot soz they absorb dressing)  
Garnish with parsely.

## Take 1 notes:
4 potatoes makes a lot of wedges...but still fits grill.  Cut 'em in half, then do either thirds or fourths depending on how big they are.

I FORGOT THE PAPRIKA STEP!!!  

Went way too salty with the dressing.  Maybe 1 TSP kosher salt, and 1-2 TBSP pepper?
