# Grilled Potato Wedges

* 2 lemons
* red wine vinegar
* 4 russet potatos
* Smoked paprika
* Pepper
* Kosher salt
* Parsley
* Canola Oil
* Olive Oil
* 1/4 cup Mayo
* 2 TBSP dijon mustard

Cut potatos into wedges.  Place in dutch oven, and cover with water.  Add about a tsp salt.

Cover and bring to boil, then remove lid, reduce heat so it's simmering rather than boil, and let 'em cook for 5-10 min.
Want only slight resistence from fork.  Let cool a little.

Cut lemons in half, and grill 'em up.

Brush potatos with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until nicely marked and done, 2-3 min on high.

For dressing, whisk together 1/4 cup mayo, 2 tbsp dijon, 2 TBSP red wine vinegar, juice from lemons.  
Then wisk in 1/4 cup olive oil.  Season with a little salt, and generous amount of pepper.

Pull potatos from Grill to platter, drizzle dressing (whilst still hot), and garnish with parsely.
