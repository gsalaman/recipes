- Bake ~25 min
- Rest 10 min.
- Cool 2 hrs

* 2 sticks butter
* 3/4 cup cake flour (plus some for pan)
* 10 oz chocolate bits (4 for cake, 6 for frosting)
* 2 TBSP rum.
* 3 eggs
* almods...some pulverized for flour, some for decoration
* almond extract

First step:  take out butter.  One stick is for cake, 6 TBSP for frosting, 2 tbsp for pan.  Read through batter steps here…they all need to go fairly uniformly!!!

Butter the cake pan, then sift and coat with cake flour.  Bang against sink to free excess flour.

Bring water to almost simmering, then take off heat.  Use double boiler to melt 4 oz (2/3 cup) chocolate in 2 TBSP rum.
Stir a little, then let sit whilst you prep the rest.  (Use rubber spatula!)

Put down a piece of parchment paper, and sift 1/2 and 1/4 cup cake flour.  

Preheat oven to 350 here.

In stand mixer, cream 1 stick butter with 2/3 cup sugar.  If the butter is too soft, you can mix it over cold water…but probably not necessary.  Want this mixture light.
While this is creaming, separate 3 eggs.  Whites go in the metal bowl.   (gonna use hand mixer)
Then, add yolks to the butter/sugar mixture and cream together.

Next, do egg whites.  Add in pinch (scant 1/4 tsp) cream of tartar and salt (pinch…scant 1/4 tsp) when they start to foam.
As soon as they’re holding shape, add another 2 TBSP sugar.  Then go for soft peaks…don’t overbeat!

Now the clock is going!  Finish stirring the chocolate, then add this to the yolk mixture.  Add in 1/3 cup pulvarized almonds and 1/4 tsp almond extract.
Add the 3/4 cup flour.
Then fold in the whites…do 1/4 of them first and stir, then drop the rest in and fold.

Put the mix in a pan, and run it around the edges. 
Bake 25 min at 350 until the outside is set, but the middle is still a little moist.

Take out, let cool for 10 min, then unmold on a cooling rack, and let cool for 2 hrs.

Frosting:
You have a stick of butter out still, right?  :)  
2/3 cup of bits  
6 TBSP butter   
Even though this does too much, going to 1/2 cup bits is too little.  
Let sit until firm (or beat over cold water), then ice the cake!  If you try and ice when it’s runny, it won’t work.
