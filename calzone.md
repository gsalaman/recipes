# Dough for calzones
Epicurious pizza dough (try for calzones):
* 3/4 cup water
* 1 envelope yeast 2.25 tsp
* 2 cups flour
* 1 tsp sugar
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 3 tbsp olive oil

Water + Yeast, mix, let activate (10m).

Mix together flour, sugar, salt.  Add yeast mix + 3 tbsp oil.  mix, then knead.
Coat bowl with oil, cover w/plastic wrap, let rise (about 1 hr).

I like filling with pizza or italian cheese mix, and a little garlic...as well as whatever other toppings you want to put in.  Make sure you only fill *half* of the circle.

Brush with egg wash

Bake at 400 deg for 10-13 min
