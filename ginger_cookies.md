# Ginger Cookies

Half batch (the full recipe from BH&G makes ~80, which is what I did in 1/4/25, so feel free to 'double' this back to the baseline if you're in the market for a ton of cookies - there are two additions to their base recipe as well as using a bit more cinnamon):

* Ingredients
  * 2.25 C AP flour
  * 2 tsp ground ginger
  * 1 tsp baking soda
  * 1 tsp ground cinnamon (they call for .75, I go a bit over)
  * 1/8 tsp salt
  * 0.5 tsp ground clove
  
  * 0.75 C or 144g vegetable shortening (crisco!)
  * 1C or 150g sugar
  * 1 egg
  * 0.25 C molasses
  * ~0.5 C candied ginger (optional, not in base recipe)
  * ~1 thumb fresh ginger (optional, not in base recipe)
  
  * raw sugar (I think we specifically use the 'sugar in the raw' brand of large amber crystals) for finishing

* Dough assembly
  * Mix the dries in a large bowl (flour, ground ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves)
  * Peel and dice the fresh ginger as finely as you can stand, I try to get this very fine
  * Candied ginger can be tough - soak it in very hot to boiled water for ~30s and then chop into tiny pieces (these can be larger than the fresh ginger, 'pea-sized' is good)
  * In your stand mixer, whip up the shortening for ~60s and then add the sugar, scraping down the sides and going until homogenous
  * Add the egg and molasses and homogenize again
  * Add the fresh and candied ginger and mix it up
  * Finally, working the dough minimally, add in the flour mixture (noting that there will be a dry patch at the bottom of the stand mixer bowl - finish mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or something else quite rigid when you can no longer see flour)
  * Let the dough chill as long as you can stand - it can sit in the fridge for a day, but ours was just about 40-50F and I juggled the balls and the dough in and out of the freezer throughout the process and they were flatter than usual but no worse to eat

* Baking
  * Preheat your oven to 350F
  * Shape the dough into balls a bit smaller than a golf ball, maybe 80% the diameter
  * Store balls and dough not actively in use in the fridge or freezer
  * I like to use parchment paper on the cookie sheet, and find that no more than 15 should go on a tray, maybe even 12 if you find them spreading.
  * Press one face of each ball into a small dish of raw sugar so there's a crunchy coating on the top
  * Give them 5 more minutes in the freezer if you can stand it
  * Bake for ~11-14 minutes, rotating the tray at 6 or so if you notice that there are hot spots in the oven
