# St Louis Apricot BBQ sauce

This makes a big batch...I'd use the big saucepan for this.  

* 1 stick butter
* 1 jar apricot or peach jelly
* 1/4 cup Worcheshire 
* 1/4 cup mustard
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tbsp liquid smoke
* 2 cups ketchup
* 1 cup cider viengar
* 1/2 cup molasses
* 1/2 tsp pepper (pepper to taste...tweak this)

Stir and simmer in saucepan.  If the jam is "chunky", use an emulsion blender to make it smooth.
