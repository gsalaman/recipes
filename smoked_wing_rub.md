WAAAAY too much!!!!  Go lighter next time.

For 6 lbs wings

* 2 TBSP Chili Powder  (I'm trying chipotle chili powder...)
* 2 TBSP Paprika
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 3 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp cayenne

Use 2 tsp olive oil as binder.  Let sit in fridge for at least an hour.

Smoke over 225-250 with pecan wood for 2 to 2.5 hrs.

Put over direct coals to crisp...5 min a side.

Let rest 10 min.

## Take 2 rub:

Going for less spicy...closer to what Alli uses when she roasts chicken.
