# Chocolate Souflee

Based on Chef John version....the martha and julia's didn't do as well.

John version, for 2.  Note only one egg yolk here, so must do multiples of 2.  That multiple of 2 fit in 3 ramekins fairly well...

Preheat oven to 375  
Brush ramekins with melted butter.  Coat insides with sugar.

2 oz 70% dark chocolateâ€¦double boiler, water just below simmer.

Melt 1 TBSP butter over medium heat.  Add1 TBSP Flour, whisk until mixture thickens.  Reduce heat to low, whisk in cold milk (4 1/3 TBSP)  Whisk until thickens (2-3 min)  Remove skillet from heat, and transfer mixture to bowl with melted chocolate.  Add in pinch of salt and cayenne pepper.  Mix throughouly.    Add in (1) egg yolk. mix to combine, and leave in above hot (not simmering) water. 

Put 2 egg whites in mixing bowl..  Add pinch of cream of tartar.  Whisk until ribbon stage.  Add in 1 TBSP sugar, little at a time, until combined.   go for shaving cream stage.

Put little less than 1/2 of egg white mix into chocolate, and mix until incorporated.  Last of egg whites get folded in gently.  

Cook 12-15 min.  (first time:  14 min)
