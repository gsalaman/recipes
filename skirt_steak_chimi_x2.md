From https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/grilled-skirt-steak-with-green-and-smokey-red-chimichurri-recipe-1924865

All ingredients:

* 1c flat leaf parsley
* 1/2c mint
* 1/2c oregano
* 1/2c canola oil
* 1/4c red wine vinegar
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 8 cloves garlic
  
Marinade, for 1.5 lbs skirt:
* 1c flat leaf parsley
* 1/2c mint
* 1/2c oregano
* 1/2c canola oil
* 1/4c red wine vinegar
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper
* 8 cloves garlic

Combine in food processor.  Marinate for 4 hrs to 24 hrs.

Red Chimi:
* 1c flat leaf parsley
* 1/2c extra virgin olive oil
* 1/4c red wine vinegar
* 2 tbsp oregano
* 1 TBSP finely chopped chipotle pepper in adobo
* 1 TBSP smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper
* 3 cloves garlic

Flay did all this in a mortar and pestle, with a little salt and pepper.  I'm gonna try food processor.

Take out steak about 30 min before grilling to bring to room temp.

Preheat grill to hot.

Grill for 5 min a side...want char, but medium rare.

Cut against the grain.
