Pasta e Fagole

This is the full…for 3, I’d half it.

* 6 cups chcken broth
* 1 19 oz can cannoellini beans
* 1 14.5 can diced domatoes
* 2 bay leaves
* salt
* 2 teaspons fresh minced oregano (or 1/2 dry)
* 4 slices bacon
* 1 onion
* Garlic
* 2 carrots
* 1/2 cup small pasta (mini ziti, ditallini….)
* 1 cup cut green beans
* parmesean

heat broth, rinsed beans, drained tomatoes, oregano, bay leaves, and 1/2 tsp salt, covered.   Bring to boil, and set aside.

While this is heating, cut bacon into small pieces.  Put in 12” skillet on medium high until fat rendered.  I’d go ’til bacon is brown next time…
While that’s cooking, chop onion. 
Add onion to bacon pan.  with 1/4 tsp salt.  Cook until Browned.  (8 min-ish)
Cut carrots and beans while that’s browning.
Once onion is browned, add 3 heaping spoonfuls garlic, cook until fragrant (30s?)

Add this bacon mix to the broth pan.  Add the carrots, beans, and pasta, and cook until tender, 9-11 min.
Remove bay leaves.
Serve with grated parm on the side.
