# Cheese Rellanos

This is taken from Bayless' cheese rellano recipie [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55wc9ZnfyvE).  

That one is also based on his standard picadillo rellano recipie [here](https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/classic-chiles-rellenos/)

Ingredients:
* Cooking oil...I like peanut.
* 6 poblanos (or Passila).  Avoid twists and deep indentations, preferrably with long stems
* 16 oz Monterray Jack Cheese
* 8 oz Queso Quesidilla Cheese
* 1 Medium white onion
* 28 oz crushed tomatos
* 1/2 TSP cinnamon
* 1/2 TSP black pepper
* 1 cup veggie broth
* 6 large eggs
* All-purpose flour (2 TBSP for batter, about 1c for dredging chilis
* Salt
* Creme of Tartar

Other tools:
* metal spoon/spatula/tongs
* thermometer for the oil
* toothpicks/skeweres
* parchment paper
* paper towels
* long nosed pliers

This is gonna take about 4 hours, so start at 2 for a 6pm dinner.

Start by heating the oil to 350-375 to blister the skins.  
While this is coming up to temp, prep a baking sheet lined with paper towels to hold the "done ones".
Do two chilis at a time...they should sizzle...and the whole key here is gonna be "power control" on the temp to keep it in that range...low is okay, but if you go too high, bad things can happen.
Bayless says it should take a minute for both chilis, turning frequently, but I found it was closer to 2 or 3.

Once all chilis are done, wait for them to cool.  This is a good time to mix together the cheese in a big bowl.
This kinda depends on what you can find in the grocery store...I found shredded jack and quesidilla, but Bayless also likes chihuaha or asedero...and oaxian will probalby work as well.

Then, for each chili:
* Scrape off the skin.  Cold water helps.  
* cut a slit...leave some room at the top and bottom.
* Remove seeeds and as much of the membranes as you can get.  Try not to make that slit longer (but it *will* happen)
* Return to tray to dry

Then, after you've done all 6 chilis, stuff with cheese mixture, and use skewers to close them up.  
Overstuffing makes it harder for the skewers to keep 'em shut...and it helps to overlap the slit.

Put them on a sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for at least an hour.  If you started at 2, it should be about 3:30 now....so 4:30 is gonna be fry time.

Sometime around 4, start the sauce:
* Chop the onion into 1/4" pieces, and brown over medium heat (prolly 10 minutes).
* Raise heat to med high, add:
  * Crushed Tomatos
  * 1/2 TSP cinnamon
  * 1/2 TSB black pepper
  * 1 cup veggie broth...I just added 1c water and 1 tsp better-than-bouilion
 Simmer it down a until it's a brothy tomato soup, then partially cover and do a low simmer.  Do a quick taste...it may need a little salt.

At 4:30, start reheating the oil to 360.

Take out the skewers from the peppers...but this is gonna be tough, as they've frozen!  Use long nose pliers, and twist before pulling.
Put the peppers back in the freezer...you want them frozen as you are battering them so they stay closed.

Make the batter:
* Seperate 6 large eggs.  
* Put whites in mixer, and add 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch of creme of tartar.  Go for stiff peaks.
* Fold in remaining yolks, 2 at a time.
* Fold in 2 TBSP flour.
Keep this batter in the fridge between assembles.

Preheat oven to 400 here

Fry time!
Set up a plate with 1 cup flour.   
Roll chili in flour, then batter, then put in fryer.  Bayless wants you to do 2 chilis at a time, but I think 1 is the right number (even though it takes longer).
Do 3-4 min per side...and the whole trick here is to NOT lose batter when you flip them...so basting the top constantly to set the batter is important.  I also tried pushing the chili completely in the oil...or doing the two spatula trick...but none were consistent.

After they're all done frying, bake for 15 min.

As they're baking, taste the sauce...does it need more salt?  Maybe a pinch of sugar?

Want them to cool a little before serving...they've got molten cheese in them!!!
