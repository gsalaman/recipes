Need a while for this...recommend starting at 3 for a 5:30 dinner.

Ingredients:
* 1 4-lb whole chicken
* 2 onions
* 1 3" piece ginger, peeled and halved lenghwise
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 TBSP coriander seeds
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 star anise pod (found with mexican spices)
* 2 whole cloves
* 1/4 cup fish sauce
* 12 oz dried rice noodles (1/8" or vermacelli)
* 2 scallions
* bean sprouts
* cilantro
* Thai Basil leaves
* Lime Wedges
* Thinly sliced serrano
* Hoisin Sauce
* Sriracha

First step...break down the chicken:
* Cut out backbone.
* Flip it over so breast is facing you, and push down to break breastbone.
* Flip back over, and use shears to cut into 2 halves.
* For each half, cut out leg quarter and wing from each breast.

Halve and peel one of the onions.  
Peel ginger piece, and slice lenghtwise.

Put 12 cups of water into pot to see where water level is there.  
Add Chicken parts (everything!), onion, ginger, 2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp sugar to pot.  Bring to boil.

Once boiling, reduce heat to mild simmer.  
Continue cooking, skimming off scum occasionally until breasts reach 160-165.  
This is supposed to take 15 min, but for me, it was closer to 30 min.  
Transfer breasts to a plate.  
Add 1 TBSP coriander seeds, cinamon stick, anise pod, and cloves to broth.  Cover and continue to simmer for 1 more hour.  
Check broth occasionally and adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer.

At t-15 on that hour, do some more prep:
Slice thin half of that other onion.   
Cut up scallions.  
Create cilantro leaves.   
Shred those chicken breasts.


You are going to want to soak the noodles in water for 20 min, until pliable...so do that right before next step.
Start boiling water for noodles.

Remove legs quarters to plate.  Discard everything else, and strain broth through fine mesh strainer with a double layer of cheesecloth.  
Rince pot, return broth to pot...should have 12 cups, so remember where that line was.  Add water if you need to.  
Stir in 1/4 cup fish sauce, cover, and keep warm over low heat.  

Prep garnish plate:
* rinsed bean sprouts
* Thai basil
*  Cilantro
* Lime wedges
* Serranos probably in seperate dish

Shred dark meat.

Drain noodles.
Add noodles to boiling water, and cook, stirring frequently.  They say this should take 30-60 seconds...took longer to get the noodles where I wanted them.
Drain immediatley.

To stage:
* noodles on bottom.
* Some chicken (unless you are alli)
* Scallions and onion.
* Broth.
