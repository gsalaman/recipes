# Texas BBQ Sauce

from https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sweet-and-spicy-bbq-sauce-texas-style-3339224

## Take 1
Add 1/2 cup finely chopped onion (one half a medium onion) to large saucepan with bacon grease (1-2 spoonfulls).  Brown over med-high heat (7).

Add 2 spoonfulls garlic.  Cook another 2 minutes.

Add one 6-oz can tomato paste.  Cook this, stirring occasionally.  3 min.

Whisk in:
* 1 cup beef stock
* 1/2 cup LOOSELY packed brown sugar
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp cayenne (could do 1)
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper.


Bring to a simmer...let cook 15-20 min until thickened.

NOTES ON TAKE 1:  
Did immersion blender during simmer.  Go to smaller saucepan to make this easier, or double the batch.

I think I want a little less sweet:   Maybe 1/4 brown sugar?

I think I want a little more tangy:  1/2 cup apple cider?

And more peppery?  1 TSP black pepper?

But...if I do all that, I just end up with memphis....
