# Smoked Brisket
This one is gonna look a little different...expecting several iterations.  Will keep "best" on top.

## Take 1:  8/4/22
Largely based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJokPNc5vaA.  Also used info from "mad scientist BBQ".

Started with a 12.75 lb choice brisket from costco.  Trimmed the afternoon before....trimming is tough!  Important bits:
* Start by squaring it up...that'll give you a feel of how thick the fat cap is.  
* There is a *LOT* of fat...my 12+ lb yielded about 4.5# fat.
* I'm leaving on the mohawk for burnt ends...we'll see how that goes.  
* Keep checking for bald spots.  If you get one, stop and reset!
* This size *JUST* fit on the bottom grill of the weber.

Injected with beef broth.

Rub:
* 1/2 cup kosher salt
* 1/2 cup course ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp garlic powder
* 2 tbsp paprika

MAAAAYbe used 1/4 of this.  Rub as coals are going.

Using Pecan wood.
