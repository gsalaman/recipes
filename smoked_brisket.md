# Smoked Brisket
This one is gonna look a little different...expecting several iterations.  Will keep "best" on top.

## Take 1:  8/4/22
Largely based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJokPNc5vaA.  Also used info from "mad scientist BBQ".

Started with a 12.75 lb choice brisket from costco.  Trimmed the afternoon before....trimming is tough!  Important bits:
* Start by squaring it up...that'll give you a feel of how thick the fat cap is.  
* There is a *LOT* of fat...my 12+ lb yielded about 4.5# fat.
* I'm leaving on the mohawk for burnt ends...we'll see how that goes.  
* Keep checking for bald spots.  If you get one, stop and reset!
* This size *JUST* fit on the bottom grill of the weber.

Injected with beef broth.

Rub:
* 1/2 cup kosher salt
* 1/2 cup course ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp garlic powder
* 2 tbsp paprika

MAAAAYbe used 1/4 of this.  Rub as coals are going.

Using Pecan wood.

## Take 2: 8/20/22  
16# brisket trimmed to 11.25.

Lighter on rub...about half way.  Didn't like that as much...going to go heavier next time.

Point went buttery quickly...flat never quite got there.  Had rain which interrupted the process.  :(

Good, but not as "wow" as last time.  However, did try KC bourbon sauce on it...my new fav!

## 5/3/23
Did a 12# prime, trimmed down to #10.
Didn't let it go long enough...flat didn't get buttery enough.  Day 1 wasn't awesome, but it got a lot better after day 2.

Reheat notes:  oven, 325, covered in foil.  Need at least 30 min...maybe longer depending on how many pieces you are doing.  Putting a little beef broth in there helps.

Tried a different injection:  2c beef broth (from stock), 1/4 tsp rosemary, 1/4 tsp thyme.  Should make this the night before so that it simmers...
