# crepes

This batch makes about 8 crepes...good for 2 hungry folks.  Some people say you want to keep batter chilled and rested, some say it doesn't matter.  For take 1, I made the batter, then keep it in fridge.

Ingredients:
* 2 TBSP melted butter, + more for greasing the pan
* 3/4 c whole milk
* 1/4 c water
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 3/4 c flour
* 1 TBSP sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt

Start by melting the butter.  If you can, you want this to cool a smidge.  
Use blender to combine Milk, water, eggs.  
Add butter in slow stream (don't want to cook the eggs!)  
Add vanilla and mix.  
Now, add your dries...flour, sugar, and salt.  
Blend all together until it's smooth, scraping sides to get rogue bits of flour.  
Keep batter in fridge.  

MH cooking:  I used the good 8" nonstick on the big burner, set to 4.   
Grease pan with a spare stick of butter...light coating to give a brown crispy bit.  
Once that's heated, you are gonna want to pour a scant (white) ladle in the pan whilst swirling...I found it best to use left hand to hold pan off heat, right with the ladel.

Once the top looks non-liquid (about a minute?) flip.  Most folks use their hands, but that's too hot for me.  I used the rubber spatula...if it was set enough, I could flip the whole thing without folding.  Then cook the other side.

The fun part is topping experiments...I did std maple syrup, some of the raspberry jam...Alli says sugar and cinnamon, and my mind goes to  whipped cream with either some chocolate syrup or cut up strawberries...or even creme anglaise.

Lafaytte notes:  
Want pan hot...so I did 8 to start, then down to 7  
Make sure you don't flip too soon...they'll get into a foldy mess  

Took about 45 min to do a double batch.
