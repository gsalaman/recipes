# Cheese Souflee

Want a 7 1/2 to 8" round baking dish...3" deep.  I liked that oval one...it's close.

Total time is about an hour.

* 2 TBSP Parm, finely grated
* 2 1/2 TBSP butter
* 3 TBS flour
* 1 cup hot milk
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* pinch nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 grinds white pepper
* 5 eggs
* 1 cup grated swiss...about 4 oz.

Grate the cheese.

Butter the baking dish.  Roll grated parm around to coat.  Make a tinfoil collar that sticks up 3 inches over the baking dish...this one is a little tricky.  I like using a long piece of tinfoil, folded in half...and then molded to the baking dish and fastened with a toothpick.  Melt a little buttere and brush the top insides of this.

Preheat oven to 400.  Want lower oven here, 1/3 down.

Start 1 cup whole milk warming up.  Want this hot...almost boiling.  (small saucepan on 7)

Prep seasonings:  paprika, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

Stir and cook 2 1/2 TBSP butter and 3 TBSP flour in a saucepan over moderate heat for 2 minutes. (I used the large one). Let cool a moment, then whisk in milk vigorously.  DON'T USE METAL WHISK IF YOU ARE IN THE NON-STICK!!!
Return to heat and stir with wooden spoon.  Boil for 3 minutes until sauce is very thick.   Whisk in seasonings and remove from heat.

Start separating the eggs.  Whites go in stand mixer; yolks go one-by-one into hot sauce, whisking as you go.

Add one more eggwhite...don't need that last yolk.  Beat eggwhites until you get stiff shining peaks..usual 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp creme of tartar when they start to foam.  Look for the shine.

Fold eggwhites into bechemel...a scoop vigourosly, then folding the rest.  As you are doing each fold scoop, add sprinkling of cheese.  Save just a little (quarter cup?) for the top.

Turn this mixture into our baking dish.  Sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Put in the oven, and immediately turn down heat to 375.  Bake for 25-30 min...DONT OPEN THE OVEN BEFORE 20 MIN!!

Remove foil and serve immediately!
