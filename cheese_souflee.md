# Cheese Souflee

Want a 7 1/2 to 8" round baking dish...3" deep.  I've got an oval one that's close I'm gonna try.

* 2 TBSP Parm, finely grated
* 2 1/2 TBSP butter
* 3 TBS flour
* 1 cup hot milk
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* pinch nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 grinds white pepper
* 5 eggs
* 1 cup grated swiss

Grate the cheese.

Butter the baking dish.  Roll grated parm around to coat.  Make a tinfoil collar that sticks up 3 inches over the baking dish.

Preheat oven to 400.  Want lower oven here, 1/3 down.

Start 1cup whole milk warming up.  Want this hot...almost boiling.

Prep seasonings:  paprika, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

Stir and cook 2 1/2 TBSP butter and 3 TBSP flour in a saucepan over moderate heat for 2 minutes.  Let cool a moment, then whick in milk vigorously. 
Return to heat and stir with wooden spoon.  Boil for 3 minutes until sauce is very thick.   Whisk in seasonings and remove from heat.

Start separating the eggs.  Whites go in stand mixer; yolks go one-by-one into hot sauce, whisking as you go.

Add one more eggwhite...don't need that last yolk.  Beat eggwhites until you get stiff shining peaks.  Probably want a pinch of cream of tartar here...

Fold eggwhites into bechemel...a scoop vigourosly, then folding the rest.  As you are doing each fold scoop, add sprinkling of cheese.  Save just a little (quarter cup?)

Turn this mixture into our baking dish.  Put in the oven, and immediately turn down heat to 375.  Bake for 25-30 min...DONT OPEN THE OVEN BEFORE 20 MIN!!

Remove foil and serve immediately!
