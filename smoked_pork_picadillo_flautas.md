# Smoked Pork Picadillo Flautas

Step 1:  2 weeks before you want to do this, go buy 2 plantains.  Actually, buy 4...and use 2 for other pork stuff.

Step 2:  Smoke some pork butts.  Carolina.  Enjoy those sandwiches, tacos, etc.

So now you have leftover pork.  Here's what you need:
* Butter
* 2 ripe plantains
* 1 lb of that smoked pulled pork
* vegetable oil
* 1 white onion
* 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 2 tsp cider vinegar
* 1 cup black beans
* 1 pack (10) soft-taco size tortillas
* a little olive oil
* toothpicks

I start this about 90 minutes before dinner.

Heat up about a quarter stick of butter in a 12" skillet (8).  Slice those plantains into slabs...maybe thirds.  Fry them up.  

While the plantains are frying, slice up the white onion.  Quarter-inch pieces.

Take off the plantains, move heat down to 6, and add vegetable oil to the pan.  Brown the onion...may take about 10 minutes.

Once those are browned, add the crushed tomatoes, cinnamon, and pepper.  Mix together, turn up the heat to 8.  You want to reduce it a little bit until it's the consitency of thick tomato sauce...should only take a couple minutes.

Move the sauce to a the largeish saucepan.  Take back out a little more than a cup.  Turn off the heat to the skillet (if you haven't already) and add the pork to warm it up.

Add 1 cup of chicken broth to the saucepan, and simmer it, partially covered.  Taste it here...you probably need a touch of salt.

Now, add that other reserved sauce to the pork.  Slice up the plantains into 1/4" chuncks, and add to meat.  Rince can of black beans, add to meat. Add 2 tsp cider vinegar.  Mix everything up so that it is homogeneous.

Preheat oven to 350.  Prep baking sheet with parchment paper.

Assemble the flautas.  Put about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the mixture in a tortilla, roll it like an enchilada, and use toothpicks to keep it closed.  On the baking sheet it goes.

Repeat until you are out of mix.  Probably 8x.  Spritz them all with olive oil.

Put them in the oven, and bake until golden brown...probably 30 min.  

Serve with reserved sauce on the side.
