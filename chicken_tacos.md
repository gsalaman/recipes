# Chicken Tacos
(takes about 2 hours...3:30 start for 5:30 dinner)

For the taco filling:
* 2 lbs boneless, skinless thighs.
* Salt & pepper
* vegetable oil
* one yellow onion
* 3 spoonfuls garlic (or 3 cloves, minced)
* 1 teaspon cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 14.5 can fire roasted diced tomatos
* 1 small can chipoltle peppers in adobo sause - full 7 oz can for Glenn strenght.  Half can for "lighter".
* 1 can chicken broth (14 oz)
* 1/2 tsp brown sugar.
* 1 lime

To assemble:
* white corn tortillas
* 1 or 2 avocados
* cotija cheese
* 6 green onions
* cilantro

Put 1 tbsp oil in bottom of dutch oven on medium high heat (8).   Brown half of the thighs, 3-4 min per side (4).  Xfer to a plate, do the other half.
Whilst browning the thighs, chop up the onionâ€¦halved, thin sliced.  Also make the chicken broth at this point. 

Reduce heat to medium (6).  Add another tbsp of oil, and brown the onion, sitrring frequently.  (5 min)
Mince the chipolte peppers here.
Add garlic, cumin, cinnamon, and cook until fragrant (1 min?)
Add tomatos, broth, chipolte peppers and the sause, and brown sugar.  Bring to a boil.

Put chicken back in the pot.  Reduce heat to medium  (I did 6).Cook covered until meat registers 195 (15-20 minutes).  Yes, this is higher than you need for thighs, but they say this really loosens the fibers.  Flip chicken after 7 minutes, then every 5 minutes after that.

Remove chicken to cutting board and let cool.  
Move sauce to a blender, and process it until smooth.  
Return sauce to the pot.

Shred the chicken, either with the 2 fork method or put it in the stand mixer with the paddle attachment.  Use a towel around the outside to keep gunk in.
Add chicken back to the pot.  Cook over medium heat until sauce is thick and clings to chicken (10 min?)

This is a good time to mince the cilantro and scallions, and shred the cheese.   And cube the avocado.

Once sauce clings, juice one lime in the pot.  Stir it up, and you are ready to serve.

(makes 5 cups)

Tortillas:  preheat oven to 350.  Wrap 6 in an aluminum foil packet & put in oven for 8-10 min.
