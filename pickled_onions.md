# Quick Pickled Onions

* 1 red onion
* 3/4 cup cider vinegar
* 1/4 cup water
* 1-2 TBSP sugar (or other sweetner)
* 1 TSP salt

Simmer vinegar, water, sugar, and salt.  I tend down towards the 1 TBSP range for the sugar...maybe a little more.  Just need to go until simmer starts.

Slice thin the onion when this is simmering.

Put onion slices in a jar, and fill with (hot) simmering liquid.  Want liquid covering all the onions.

Let sit for 30 min.  Then you can refrigerate.  I keep the liquid in the jar.

Could add bell peppers, cukes, maybe even a jalepeno.
