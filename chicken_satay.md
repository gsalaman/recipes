# Chicken Satay with peanut sauce

* 2# bonless skinless thighs
* vege oil
* 2 lemongrass stalks
* 3 shallots (2/3 cup)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 1.5” piece ginger 
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp tumeric
* 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tsp ground coriander
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin

For sauce:
* 1/3 cup dry roasted peanuts
* 1 tbsp tamarind paste or t TBSP lime juice (about 1 lime)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar

Step 1:  make the paste.  
Cut the lemongrass stalks lengthwise, then dice.  Put in food processsor.  
Chop up shallots. Add to processor.  
Peel ginger, slice thin.  Add to food processsor.   
Add 2 big spoonfuls of garlic, 1 TBSP vege oil, 3 TBSP water, 1 TBSP brown sugar, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp tumeriic, and 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  
Process until uniform paste forms…probably about 2 min.  Scrape often.  

Keep 1/3 cup of the paste for the sauce.  Transfer remaining to small bowl.  Stir in 1/2 tsp coriander and 1/2 tsp cumin.  cover, microwave for 45 sec, stir, microwave for another 45 sec.  Put in fridge.

Put peanuts in now empty food processor.  Recipe says to go “coarse grind”, but Alli really didn’t like that texture.  try going for more of a peanut butter feel…may need some vege oil.  (1 TBSP?)

Then heat 2 TBSP oil and that reserved paste in a saucepan over medium low heat…I actually ended up at 5.  Want it to darken color and start to have a “fond” (brown crunchy bits)….but I didn’t go that long.  They say 5 minutes.  At this point, stir in peanuts, 3/4 cup water, 1 TBSP lime juice (or tamarand paste) and 1 TBSP brown sugar.  Bring to boil, then rduce to a simmer and reduce untiil you have about 1 cup…probably 10 minutes.  Cover.

While this is reducing, Slice up the thighs.  I found cutting them in half was about right.  Grab a bowl, take your paste outta the fridge, and coat them.  Stab ‘em across 2 skeweres.

Now grill them up.  Paint with oil on both sides.  5 min first side, then 5 on the other…but you want 175 to 180 degrees….mine took a little longer.  I used water to put out the big fire from the inital “char”.
