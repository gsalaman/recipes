# Lasagna
This is a haul, but it's yummy!  You want at least 3 hours of prep here.

## Ingredients

For the meat sauce:

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 5 oz pancetta, diced
* 1 lb hot italian sausage
* 1 lb ground beef
* 6 cloves garlic (4 big spoonfuls)
* 1 cup onion, chopped (large white)
* 3 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 1/2 cup beef stock
* 2 28 oz cans crushed tomatos
* 2 tsp sgar
* 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped  - 2 small packs
* 3 TBSP fresh parsley, chopped  + extra  
* 2 TBSP fresh oregano, chopped + extra  1/2 pack…I did 3 TBSP

For the cheese layers:
* 16 oz ricotta cheese
* 5 oz fontina cheese, grated
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 16 oz mozzerella cheese
* 1 container parmesean (1 cup)

And then the noodles...want 15.

## Directions:

Place dutch oven over medium high heat.  
Add oil and pancetta, cook for 2-3 min.
Add in sausage and beef and cook until meat is browned…5 min.

Dice onion whilst meat is browning.

Add garlic, cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
Add onion, continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent.  6-8 min.


Add 3 TBSP tomato paste.

Stir in wine.  Cook for 5 min, then stir in stock and crushed tomatoes.  Combine well, then bring to boiil.

Reduce heat to medium and cook for at least another 40 min.  2 hrs, fine.  4 hrs, fine.

Chop up basil, parsley, and oregano here.
Shred 5oz fontina.
Combine that wth 16 oz ricotta, 1 full egg, one extra egg white, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.
Put aside.

Then put about 16” of  parchment paper on counter. 
Get out the pan you are going to assemble in (9x13 casserole), grease that, and bursh the parchemt paper with olive oil.  

Start water boiling for noodles.

After (at least) 40 min of meat sauce simmering, stir in 2 tsp sugar, basil, parsley, and oregano.  Cook for another 5 min.  Taste, add salt and pepper as needed.  (1/2 TSP salt, little pepper just cause.)

Remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly before building lasagna…so this s a good time to do the noodles

Once water is boiling, add a pinch of salt.  Add noodles to pot, and cook for 4 minutes.  You don’t want them to be done…just a little flexible.
Use tongs to remove from water and stage on parchment paper, side by side so they don’t stick.
