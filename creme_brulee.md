* pinch salt
* 5 eggs
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract.
* 
This is a "half" recipie...fills 8 smaller ramekins or 4 of my bigger ones.  I do the vanilla extract thing...I find it easier (and just as tasty) as boiling the vanilla bean.

preheat oven to 300

Place towel on bottom of large roasting pan and arrange ramekins

Bring kettle of water to boil over high heat


Combine 1 cup heavy cream, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, and pinch of salt togeter in a medium saucepan.  Bring to boil over medium heat, dissolving sugar.  Remove pan from heat and let steep for 15 min.

Stir in 1 more cup cream to cool down mixture.  

Whisk 5 egg yolks together in bowl until uniform.  Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture until loosened and combined.  Add 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Whisk again with another 1/2 cup.  Then do the rest.  (Strain into a 2 quart pitcher…discard solids.  Not necessary as we're not doing vanilla bean)  Pour this evenly into the ramekins.

Gently place the baking dish on the oven rack.  Pour boiling water into the baking dish…don’t splash any water into the ramekins!!!  Want water at about 2/3 height of ramekins.  

Bake until centers of custard are just barely set and are no longer sloshy.  Digital read thermometer registers 170 to 175.  Should be about 30 to 35 minutes.  Check at 20 min on…

Transfer remekins to wire rack, let cool to room temp (2 hrs). Wrap and refridgerate…4 hours or multiple days.

To serve:  wipe off any condensation with paper towel.  Sprinkle each with about 1 tsp turbinado…get even coverage (tilt & tap)  
Carmelize sugar with flame about 1 inch from surface of custard until sugar melts.  Refridgerate to rechill…about 30 min (BUT NO LONGER!!!)
