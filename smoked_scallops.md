# Smoked Scallops  

Recipe from https://agrillforallseasons.com/smoked-scallops/

5-6 scallops go on a skewer, so buy depending on how many skewers you want.  First try: Andy got some from Blue Reef Fish Market, right near "Your Butcher Frank"

Soak scallops overnight in mixture of milk, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.

Cut up lemon into slices, slice those in quarters.

Pat scallops dry.

Assemble on skewers, alternating scallops and lemon wedge.  I did the scallops perpendicular the first time...I think I want to try doing them lengthwise next time to get a more even cook.

LIGHTLY season with kosher salt and pepper...go less than what you'd do for steak.
For next time, also try *LIGHT* dusting of cayenne for a kick.  (maybe try that on only one skewer to start?)

First take I smoked with Pecan...may want to try a stronger wood...maybe cherry?  Recipie does 2 parts cherry, one part hickory...should try that next time.

Want to go a little lower temp than normal...200ish.  Going for 125 degree internal...and NOT more than 135.

First time took about 40 min...these go quick!

And that dill sauce I do for the salmon pairs beautifully!  Bearnaise is a little too overpowering.
