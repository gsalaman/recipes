## Rub
For 4-5 lbs belly:
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 2 tbsp kosher salt
* 1 tbsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp paprika
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp cayenne

## Prep
Trim skin and totp layer of fat from belly.  Make 1 1/2 inch cubes.

Rub meat with olive oil, and use rub generously over the meat.

## Smoking
I liked cherry wood.  Want 225-250 temp.

They want you to put the belly on a wire rack, but I found those cubes worked just fine on the grill.

Smoke for 2 1/2 to 3 hrs, until nice bark forms.

Transfer cubes to disposable aluminium pan.  Add:
* 1/2 to 1 cup memphis sauce
* 4 TBSP butter (half stick) cut into pads
* 1/3 cup honey.  

Coat all the meat, cover with foil.

Put pan back in smoker, and cook until meat register 200-205 (another 60-90 min)

Remove foil, cook uncovered until sauce thickens a bit...they say 15 min, but I needed longer.
